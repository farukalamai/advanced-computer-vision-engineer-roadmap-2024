 - While Loop, Nested Loops, Loop Else
 - For Loop, Break, and Continue statements
 - Functions, Return Statement, Recursion
 - File Handling, Exception Handling
 - Object-Oriented Programming

# 2. OpenCV with Python
OpenCV is a powerful open-source library designed for computer vision and machine learning tasks. It is widely used in various fields due to its versatility and efficiency.

 - What are images/Videos?
 - Input / Output
 - Basic operations
 - Colorspaces, Drawings, Contours
 - Blurring, Threshold
 - Edge detection
 - histograms, and morphological transformations

# 3. Mathematics and Algorithms
   - **Linear Algebra and Calculus**: Understand the math behind image processing, including matrix operations, convolution, and transformations.

# 7. Real-Time Applications
   - **Embedded Systems**: Learn about deploying computer vision models on devices like Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, or mobile devices.
   - **Optimization for Real-Time**: Techniques like model quantization and pruning for running models efficiently on edge devices.

# 8. Software Skills
To effectively integrate computer vision into web applications, here are the software skills you should focus on:
### a. **Web Development Basics**
   - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: These are fundamental for building the frontend of web applications. Understanding how to create and manipulate web pages is crucial.
   - **Frontend Frameworks**: Learn a frontend framework like **React.js** or **Vue.js** to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### b. **Backend Development**
   - **Flask/Django**: Since you already know Python, learning Flask or Django will help you create robust backend servers that can handle requests and integrate with computer vision models.
   - **RESTful APIs**: Understand how to create and consume RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend. This is essential for sending image data to the server and receiving processed results.
   - **WebSockets**: Learn WebSockets for real-time data transmission if your application requires live video streaming or real-time updates.

### c. **Database Management**
   - **SQL/NoSQL Databases**: Learn to use databases like PostgreSQL (SQL) or MongoDB (NoSQL) for storing and retrieving data, such as processed images, metadata, or user information.

### d. **Deployment and Cloud Services**
   - **Docker**: Learn Docker to containerize your computer vision applications, making them portable and easier to deploy across different environments.
   - **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Familiarize yourself with cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. Learn to deploy your applications on these platforms and use their services, such as S3 for storage or EC2 for running your models.
     
### e. **Web Frameworks for Computer Vision**
   - **TensorFlow.js**: Learn TensorFlow.js to run machine learning models directly in the browser using JavaScript, enabling client-side computer vision tasks.
   - **OpenCV.js**: Understand how to use OpenCV.js, a JavaScript binding for OpenCV, to perform image processing directly in the browser.


# Work On Real-World Hands-On Computer Vision Projects
