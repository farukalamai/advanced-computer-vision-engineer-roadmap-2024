# 3. Deep Learning and Machine Learning
Know-How of Image Processing Tools and Methods 
TensorFlow 

Tensorflow is an open-source library for machine learning to develop and train neural networks for deep learning and many machine learning models that use heavy numerical computation. It was developed by the Google Brain team back in 2015

YOLO

You Only Look Once, or YOLO is a real-time object detection algorithm. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks as its core to detect objects in real-time.

OpenCV

OpenCV is an open-source library for image processing and computer vision tasks.


Keras

Keras is an open-source library for python that is used to implement deep learning models. It acts as a wrapper over Theono and Tensorflow libraries. 

CUDA

CUDA is an API developed by Nvidia for parallel computing and graphical processing that uses GPU to boost performance.


PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source library in python offering easy-to-use methods for natural language processing and image processing. 

Some other libraries used widely in computer vision are OpenGL, PyTorch, Dlib, PyTesseract, Scikit-image, Matplotlib, IPSDK, Mahotas, FastAI etc. It is good to have the know-how of at least two or more of the libraries mentioned above.

Step 5- Learn Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
CNN is used to construct the majority of computer vision algorithms.

Convolutional Neural Network is an algorithm of Deep Learning. That is used for Image Recognition and Natural Language Processing. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) takes an image to identify its features and predict it.

Step 6- Learn Recurrent neural networks (RNN) 

Computer Vision Techniques to Master
Following are some important computer vision techniques:

Image segmentation

It is the process of breaking the image into segments for easier processing and representation. Each component is then manipulated individually with attention to different characteristics. 

Semantic segmentation
Semantic segmentation identifies objects in an image and labels the object into classes like a dog, human, burger etc. Also, in a picture of 5 dogs, all the dogs are segmented as one class, i.e. dog.

There are two ways to go about semantic segmentation. One is the route of classic and traditional algorithms, while the other dives into deep learning.

Fully Convolutional Network, U-net, Tiramisu model, Hybrid CNN-CRF models, Multi-scale models are examples of Deep Learning algorithms. 

Grey level segmentation and conditional random fields are examples of traditional algorithms for Image Segmentation.

Instance Segmentation 
Unlike semantic segmentation, objects in the image that are similar and belong to the same class are also identified as distinct instances. Usually more intensive as each instance is treated individually, and each pixel in the image is labelled with class. Itâ€™s an example of dense prediction.

For example, in an image of 5 cats, each cat would be segmented as a unique object.

Some common examples of image segmentation are:

Autonomous Driving Cars

Medical Image Segmentation

Satellite Image Processing

Object Localisation 

Object localisation is the process of detecting the single most prominent instance of an object in an image.

Object Detection

Object detection recognises objects in an image with the use of bounding boxes. It also measures the scale of the object and object location in the picture. Unlike object localisation, Object detection is not restricted to finding just one single instance of an object in the image but instead all the object instances present in the image.

Object Tracking

Object tracking is the process of following moving objects in a scene or video used widely in surveillance, in CGI movies to track actors and in self-driving cars. It uses two approaches to detect and track the relevant object/objects. The first method is the generative approach which searches for regions in the image most similar to the tracked object without any attention to the background. In comparison, the second method, known as the discriminative model, finds differences between the object and its background. 

Image Classification

Classification means labelling images or subjects in the image with a class that relates to the meaning. Following are some of the standard image classification algorithms you must know -

Parallelepiped classification 

Minimum distance classification

Mahalanobis classification

Maximum likelihood

Some common examples of classification are:

Image recognition, object detection, object tracking.

Face Recognition

Face recognition is a non-trivial computer vision problem used to recognise faces in an image and tag the faces accordingly. It uses neural networks and deep learning models like CNN, FaceNet etc. 

Firstly, the face is detected and bordered with bounding boxes. Features from the faces are extracted and normalised for comparison. These features are then fed to the model to label the face with a name/title. 

Optical Character Recognition 

OCR is used for converting printed physical documents, texts, bills to digitised text, which is for many other applications. It is a crossover of pattern recognition and computer vision. A popular open-source OCR engine developed by HP and Google and written in C++ is Tesseract. To use Tesseract-OCR in python, one must call it from Pytesseract. 

Image Processing 

One needs to have a ground understanding of simple image processing techniques like histogram equalisation, median filtering, RGB manipulation, image denoising and image restoration. Image regeneration or restoration is a prevalent technique of taking a degraded noisy image and generating a clean image out of it. The input image can be noisy, blurred, pixelated or tattered with old age. Image restoration uses the concept of Prior to fill in the gaps in the image and tries to rebuild the image in steps. In each iteration the image is refined, finally outputting the restored image. 

# Software Skills
To effectively integrate computer vision into web applications, here are the software skills you should focus on:

### a. **Web Development Basics**
   - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: These are fundamental for building the frontend of web applications. Understanding how to create and manipulate web pages is crucial.
   - **Frontend Frameworks**: Learn a frontend framework like **React.js** or **Vue.js** to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

### b. **Backend Development**
   - **Flask/Django**: Since you already know Python, learning Flask or Django will help you create robust backend servers that can handle requests and integrate with computer vision models.
   - **RESTful APIs**: Understand how to create and consume RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend and backend. This is essential for sending image data to the server and receiving processed results.
   - **WebSockets**: Learn WebSockets for real-time data transmission if your application requires live video streaming or real-time updates.

### c. **Database Management**
   - **SQL/NoSQL Databases**: Learn to use databases like PostgreSQL (SQL) or MongoDB (NoSQL) for storing and retrieving data, such as processed images, metadata, or user information.

### d. **Deployment and Cloud Services**
   - **Docker**: Learn Docker to containerize your computer vision applications, making them portable and easier to deploy across different environments.
   - **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Familiarize yourself with cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure. Learn to deploy your applications on these platforms and use their services, such as S3 for storage or EC2 for running your models.
     
### e. **Web Frameworks for Computer Vision**
   - **TensorFlow.js**: Learn TensorFlow.js to run machine learning models directly in the browser using JavaScript, enabling client-side computer vision tasks.
   - **OpenCV.js**: Understand how to use OpenCV.js, a JavaScript binding for OpenCV, to perform image processing directly in the browser.
